## About Our Project
North America Word Chain is a software application designed to enhance users' knowledge of North Americaâ€™s states and their capital cities through an engaging word chain game. Players are required to form chains of words where each word begins with the last letter of the previous word, using only the names of North America's states/provinces and their corresponding capital cities.

## About the development
Our course project involved the development of an educational word game focused on North American cities and provinces/states. While adhering to the mandatory functionalities outlined by the professor, we expanded the scope of the project by incorporating additional features to enhance the overall gameplay experience. The project was implemented using Java, and we provided comprehensive documentation, an executable JAR file, source code, unit tests, and JavaDoc to facilitate understanding and maintenance.

My primary responsibility in this project involved the development of the graphical user interface (GUI) and frontend components. I focused on creating an intuitive and visually appealing user experience that would enhance player engagement. Additionally, I actively contributed to the backend by developing supplementary game logic, debugging existing code within the GamePlay.java module, and performing integration testing to ensure seamless functionality between all components. Our team employed the Agile methodology, facilitating iterative development through consistent weekly meetings where we tracked progress, identified and addressed potential issues, and efficiently managed tasks.

## Required Libraries and Third-Party Tools
JDK 22

## Installation
You must have JDK downloaded on your device. If you don't have one, install through Oracle: https://www.oracle.com/ca-en/java/technologies/downloads/

To install the Word Chain Game, follow these steps:
  1) Download WorldChain.JAR file. It has to be in your default directory (documents, downloads etc).
  2) Go to your device's terminal.
  3) Move to the directory where WorldChain.jar is located in using the command: cd "Your File Location". If you have created a folder inside of your
  directory, then make sure you cd "File Location" until you are in the directory. You can type in ls to see the content of the file.
  4) IMPORTANT: Make sure facts.csv and your WorldChain.JAR file is in the same folder! It will not load the data and you won't be able to play the
  game. If you want background music, make sure the WAV files are in the same directory as well.
  5) Type command: java -jar WorldChain.jar
