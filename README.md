## About Our Project
North America Word Chain is a software application designed to enhance users' knowledge of North Americaâ€™s states and their capital cities through an engaging word chain game. Players are required to form chains of words where each word begins with the last letter of the previous word, using only the names of North America's states/provinces and their corresponding capital cities.

## About the development
Our course project entailed developing an educational game centered on a word chain featuring North American cities and provinces/states. Initially, the professor outlined mandatory functionalities, which we augmented with additional features to enrich the gameplay, as documented in our Requirement Documentation. Leveraging Java, we implemented the project, providing comprehensive documentation, an executable JAR file, source code, unit tests, and JavaDoc. 

In our project, I took on the primary responsibility of GUI/frontend development and integration testing, striving to create an intuitive and visually appealing user experience. Additionally, I made substantial contributions to the backend, particularly in troubleshooting errors within the GamePlay.java module. Throughout our project, we followed Agile methodology, which enabled iterative development through weekly group meetings focused on tracking progress and managing tasks effectively.

## Required Libraries and Third-Party Tools
JDK 22

## Installation
You must have JDK downloaded on your device. If you don't have one, install through Oracle: https://www.oracle.com/ca-en/java/technologies/downloads/

To install the Word Chain Game, follow these steps:
  1) Download WorldChain.JAR file. It has to be in your default directory (documents, downloads etc).
  2) Go to your device's terminal.
  3) Move to the directory where WorldChain.jar is located in using the command: cd "Your File Location". If you have created a folder inside of your
  directory, then make sure you cd "File Location" until you are in the directory. You can type in ls to see the content of the file.
  4) IMPORTANT: Make sure facts.csv and your WorldChain.JAR file is in the same folder! It will not load the data and you won't be able to play the
  game. If you want background music, make sure the WAV files are in the same directory as well.
  5) Type command: java -jar WorldChain.jar
